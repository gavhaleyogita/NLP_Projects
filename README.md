Text Intelligence: Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Review and News article classification
 Sentiment Analysis of IMDb Movie Reviews- Conducted
 sentiment analysis on IMDb reviews by preprocessing text
 (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming) and extracting
 features using TF-IDF and Word2Vec. I then trained and
 evaluated classification models to predict review sentiment with
 high accuracy. News Article Classification - In this project, I
 classified news articles into categories like sports, politics, and
 technology using a news data category dataset. The process
 involved scraping news articles, preprocessing the text (such as
 removing stop words and tokenization), extracting features from
 the text, and building classification models to accurately
 categorize the articles into their respective topics
